#Constants explained

#Constants look a bit like variables

#But constants are declared in full caps

#For example

THREEPOINTSHOT = 3
FREE_THROW = 1

#When programmers see a constant

#It tells them not to change the value

#To display the value in the constant

#To display the value in the constant

#To display the value in the constant, the code is

print(THREEPOINTSHOT)
